# Testing Strategy for ESP32 BLE Wi-Fi Provisioning

## Prerequisites
- ESP32 development board
- Mobile device with BLE capability
- Espressif BLE Provisioning app

## Test Cases

1. BLE Advertisement
   - Power on the ESP32
   - Use a BLE scanner app to verify the device is advertising with the correct name and UUID

2. Provisioning Connection
   - Open the Espressif BLE Provisioning app
   - Scan for and connect to the ESP32 device
   - Verify successful connection

3. Security Verification
   - Attempt to provision without the correct proof of possession (pop)
   - Verify that the provisioning fails

4. Wi-Fi Credential Transfer
   - Input correct Wi-Fi credentials in the provisioning app
   - Verify that the credentials are securely transferred to the ESP32

5. Wi-Fi Connection
   - Monitor the ESP32's serial output
   - Verify that it successfully connects to the specified Wi-Fi network

6. Custom Endpoint Test
   - If implemented, test the custom endpoint by sending and receiving data

7. Provisioning Completion
   - Verify that the BLE advertisement stops after successful provisioning
   - Confirm that the device enters normal operation mode

8. Persistence Test
   - Power cycle the ESP32
   - Verify that it reconnects to the Wi-Fi network without entering provisioning mode

9. Reset Test
   - Implement and test a method to reset the device to an unprovisioned state
   - Verify that after reset, the device re-enters BLE provisioning mode

## Performance Metrics
- Measure the time taken for the entire provisioning process
- Monitor power consumption during BLE advertising and provisioning

## Security Testing
- Attempt to intercept BLE communication and verify encryption
- Try to extract Wi-Fi credentials from the ESP32's memory

## Compatibility Testing
- Test with various mobile devices and operating systems
- Verify compatibility with different Wi-Fi router configurations
